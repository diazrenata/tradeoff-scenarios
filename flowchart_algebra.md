Equation setup
==============

Variable defs:

*t*: time. At the moment I'm just using *t* = 1 and *t* = 2 in a before-and-after setup, but I think you should be able to extend this to time *series*.

*E*<sub>1</sub>, *E*<sub>2</sub>: Total energy at *t* = 1, *t* = 2

*N*<sub>1</sub>, *N*<sub>2</sub>: Total number of individuals at *t* = 1, *t* = 2

*e*<sub>1</sub>, *e*<sub>2</sub>: Average energy at *t* = 1, *t* = 2; $\\frac{E\_1}{N\_1}, \\frac{E\_2}{N\_2}$

*Δ**E*: Change in total energy as the ratio $\\frac{E\_2}{E\_1}$

*Δ**N*: Change in total individuals as $\\frac{N\_2}{N\_1}$

*Δ**e*: Change in average energy as $\\frac{e\_2}{e\_1}$
